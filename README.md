An analysis of the unemployment rates in Australia in 2020. Our hypothesis is that the COVID-19 pandemic will have impacted the unemployement rates in Australia. We were interested to see what effects that COVID had, and how it may have impacted different states.

# Questions 

Questions we had before we began our analysis:
1. Was there an increase or decrease in unemployment? 
2. How was unemployment impacted between WA amd VIC?
3. Was there a correlation between infection rates and unemployment in 2020?
